An application to show the opening status of the Stratum 0 hackerspace in the
system tray icon.

Dependencies:
 * Qt >= 4.2 (http://qt.nokia.com)
 * A C++ build system (GCC/GNU make or MS Visual C++ Express will do)

Compiling:
  qmake main.pro && make
or, if you are using MS Visual C++:
  qmake main.pro && nmake

Windows compatibility has not yet been tested by me, though some users report
that it works too.

Versioning Scheme:
The version number is calculated by the formula 1-1/(2^n), where n is
incremented with each release. This way, the version number approaches 1 as n
approaches infinity.
