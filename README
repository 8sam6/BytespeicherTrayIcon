An application to show the opening status of the Stratum 0 hackerspace in the
system tray icon.

Dependencies:
 * Qt > 4.2 (http://qt.nokia.com)
 * A C++ build system (GCC/GNU make or MS Visual C++ Express will do)

Compiling:
  qmake main.pro && make
or, if you are using MS Visual :
  qmake main.pro && nmake

Windows compatibility has not yet been tested though.

Bugs:
* Currently, the status is only fetched once at startup.
